# Comparison of crab sizes
# ========================

# Data for sizes of crabs inside and outside the no-fishing area:
inside <- c(124, 133, 145, 146, 146, 133, 139, 132, 143, 144)
outside <- c(121, 126, 137, 138, 139, 143, 130, 136, 132, 132)

# 1. Calculate the means and the difference in means


# 2. Calculate the posterior distribution of the mean for each group
#      using the default priors and plot them.


# 3. Calculate the posterior distribution for the difference in means
#      and its 95% CrI



# 4a. What's the probability that the crabs inside are bigger than outside?



# 4b. What's the probability that the difference is more than 2mm?



# 5a. Rerun 2 using a proper prior for the mean (mu) of the crab widths


# 5b. Rerun 3 and 4 with the proper prior; does it make much difference?
