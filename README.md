# BootCamp

**Materials for the "Boot Camp" in Wildlife Study Design and Data Analysis**

These Boot Camps are organised by [Biodiversity Conservation Society Sarawak (BCSS)](http://bcss.org.my/), often in conjunction with local partners.

The idea of this repository is to have an accessible place for the Boot Camp materials, including R scripts and source code for PDF handouts. We can also use the wiki to provide background information for instructors - an instructor's manual.

This is a public repository. That means that anyone can view the material here, including the wiki. They can download the material either as a single ZIP file, or they can clone to their own computer if they have [Github  Desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/installing-github-desktop/) installed. They can edit the files on their own computer and then submit a "pull request"; if the changes are useful, we can accept them.

We can designate collaborators who can edit the wiki and directly change the code.

Github provides version control, keeping a record of all the changes (who and when) and permitting a roll-back to earlier versions if required. However, that really only applies to source code based on plain text, not to PDF files or Word documents. To take advantage of this, and to move towards open source principles, we'll try using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for the source code of our PDF handouts (we currently use MS Word). This README file uses Markdown and so does the wiki.

It will take some time to get everything up on Github. We'll initially try to get some materials up and start with some wiki pages. Then we will assess whether Github is the right platform for our needs, or if there are better alternatives.
