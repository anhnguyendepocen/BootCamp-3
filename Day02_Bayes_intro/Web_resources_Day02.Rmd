Here are some useful links to resources on the internet relevant to Day 2 of the Boot Camp.

There's an introductory statistics course for college students using a Bayesian approach and with a lot of information on probability theory [here](http://bayes.bgsu.edu/nsf_web/main.htm).

Here's a [BBC article](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28166019) on doctors' underatanding of diagnostic test results.

There's a nice [biography of Poisson](http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Poisson.html) at the St Andrews University site.
